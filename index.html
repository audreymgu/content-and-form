			<h2 class="subsection">GENERAL</h2>
			<p>Gundam (Japanese: ガンダム Hepburn: <em>Gandamu</em>), also referred to as the Gundam Series (ガンダムシリーズ <em>Gandamu Shirīzu</em>), is a science fiction media franchise created by Sunrise that features giant robots (or "mecha") called "mobile suits", with titular mobile suits that carry the name "Gundam."</p>
			<p>The franchise started on April 7, 1979, as an anime TV series called Mobile Suit Gundam, which was revolutionary in that it defined the real robot genre of anime by featuring giant robots in a militaristic war setting. The popularity of the first TV series and the merchandising that followed spawned a franchise that has come to include works released in numerous media. Titles have appeared in the form of multiple television series and OVAs, movies, manga, novels, and video games. The franchise has also led to the creation of one of the biggest toy and hobby franchise in the Japanese toy industry.</p>
			<p>As of 2014, the Gundam franchise generates revenues of 80 billion yen a year. The 2014 retail sales of Gundam toy and hobby items totaled 18.4 billion yen. In the 2008 ranking of average sales figures for anime copies sold in Japan (1970–2008 total sales figures averaged by episode) Gundam series were in four of the top five places: Mobile Suit Gundam ranked second, with Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny third, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED fourth, and Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam fifth. Also, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing ranked 18th and Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ ranked 20th. Gunpla (Gundam Plastic model) holds 90% of the Japanese character plastic model market. </p>		
			<p>Academics in Japan have also viewed the series as inspiration, with the International Gundam Society being the first academic institution based on an animated TV series.</p>
			<h2 class="subsection">NARRATIVE</h2>
			<p>The general narratives of Gundam shows classify as war drama. They revolve around the mobile suits and their pilots fighting in a war, in which destruction and dehumanization are inherent, through multiple sides; each faction has their own heroes and villains, all of which have their own unique motives, failings, and virtues. Gundam features political battles and debates on important philosophical issues and political ideals on the nature and meaning of war, the ideal of pacifism, and the continuing evolution—natural or engineered—of humanity and its consequences. These are often framed in the series as a debate between the protagonist and antagonist over the course of a duel, as they try to convince each other of the righteousness of their causes. Most of the stories are structured as "coming-of-age" dramas, where the main cast's personalities, points of view, allegiances, goals, and actions may or may not change dramatically as events unfold. This makes the plot seem more realistic than earlier super robot animated series where the hero and cast usually act in the same predictable manner, with little connection between the episodes. The best example of this is how the personalities of longtime rivals, Amuro Ray and Char Aznable, are influenced by their experiences in the Gundam saga.
</p>
			<h2 class="subsection">DEFINING GUNDAM</h2>
			<p>Within the Gundam franchise, the titular term "Gundam" generally refers to a specific category of mobile suits that tend to feature design cues from Kunio Okawara's original Gundam design. Nonetheless, producer Masahiko Asano wrote in his notes on the production of Gundam Sentinel that everyone seemed to have their own idea of Gundam and, in the meeting, they were trying to find the asymptotic view for those there.</p>
			<p>The variations in naming and identification impacts the definition of the term throughout the Gundam timelines:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>	In the original Universal Century timeline, "Gundam" is the name of the Earth Federation's first experimental general-purpose mobile suit, and mobile suits based on its design. In this timeline, Gundam often stands for General-purpose Utility, Non Discontinuity Augmentation Maneuvering weapon system." </li>
				<li>In the Future Century timeline of Mobile Fighter G Gundam, the word "Gundam" refers to a class of mobile weapons, mostly mobile fighters that participate in the "Gundam Fight", a competition that determines which colony would rule the Earth every four years.</li>
				<li>In the After Colony timeline of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, the word "Gundam" refers to most mobile suits constructed out of a special alloy called "Gundanium".</li>
				<li>In the After War timeline of After War Gundam X, advanced mobile suits built from lunar titanium alloy before and during the After War era are referred to as Gundam.</li>
				<li>In the Correct Century timeline of Turn A Gundam, the name "Gundam" is given to the WD-M01 Turn A Gundam mobile suit by a specific character, who was originally an ace pilot, but was placed under suspended animation. The color scheme of the Turn A reminds the character of the Gundam mobile suits from previous eras.</li>
				<li>In the Cosmic Era timeline of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, the word Gundam is generally not referenced, but certain characters use the term to describe mobile suits that carry specific types of operating systems, whose acronym always spells "G.U.N.D.A.M."</li>
				<li>In the Anno Domini timeline of Mobile Suit Gundam 00, the term Gundam is the generic designation of a line of unique and highly effective mobile units that were built by the anti-war organization Celestial Being to use the GN-Drive. Eventually that technology spread to non-Gundam mobile suits as well.</li>
				<li>In the Advanced Generation of Mobile Suit Gundam AGE, the Gundam was a legendary mobile suit developed by ancestors of main character Flit Asuno. When he inherits the AGE Device from his mother, which contains plans of a mobile suit that resembles a painting of the Gundam he saw, he names the new mobile suit (and its successive models) after it.</li>
				<li>In the Post Disaster timeline of Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans Gundams are a series of 72 mobile suits built on a specific frame design during the Calamity War 300 years prior to the series' events. All of these Gundams are named after demons in the Ars Goetia.</li>
